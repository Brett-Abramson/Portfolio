Website: https://gentle-donut-df4ada.netlify.app/

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery were used to build this site.

My goal primarily was to implement a responsive design. I attempted to achieve this using what I know about mobile-first design. 
- By focusing on the mobile version of the website first and using responsive css like vw, %, and em.

I also wanted to include three points of interactin for the user. 
- a dropdown "hamburger" menu in the mobile version
- a modal model of the different sections of the website
- a light and dark mode toggle

The first big challenge I faced was attempting to bring my website from the mobile design to a desktop or laptop version. I no longer wanted a dropdown menu but instead a sidebar navigation. 
My solution ended up being to create two seperate menus in HTML. I first attempted to solve this with a `mobile-hide` class and a `@media(max-width)` but a new menu solved the problem with less of a headache.
	

    I would still like to implement:
        - fixed navbar
        - overall Design needs updating
        - not sure I like the mobile top bars anymore
        - I am noticing desktop version of modern websites with all content on one page and long scrolling
        - better color scheme
        if not a fixed navbar maybe it extends when pointer is near it
